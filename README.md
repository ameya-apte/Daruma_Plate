# Daruma_Plate
A simple yet effective ball balancing on a plate system.

The project is all about balancing the ball on a plate using PID control system using Arduino, Image processing using OpenCv python. 

The aim of this project is actually to understand the principle of any balancing system(drone, robotic car, basic human robot, etc.) .
